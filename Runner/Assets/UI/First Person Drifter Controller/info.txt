dead simple first person character controller written in c# for unity3d
requires 
first person drifter improves on unitys default first person controller in a few ways:

- smooths mouse input
- adds optional run mode, air control, sliding on slopes
- adds mouse lock (and unlock with ESC)

how to use:
drop the Player prefab into a scene, get rid of the Main Camera that unity makes for you. hit play.

run with left shift.

if youre getting the error 'There are 2 Audio Listeners in the scene' that means you have another camera 
in the scene, probably the default one called Main Camera. delete that.

*****************

a drifting game is a piece of art software that people walk around in for the hell of it (see: proteus)
i made this package bc i want to encourage artists & non-programmers to make more drifting games
and 2 provide users w/ controls  that behave in waays they expect

you can use this for whatever purposes, commercial or noncommercial.
like all my endeavors, i stole most of the code from ppl smarter than me
