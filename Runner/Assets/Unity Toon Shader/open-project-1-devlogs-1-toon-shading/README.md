### Unity Open Project #1: Chop Chop
# Devlog 1: The toon shading

You've landed on the repository for the first Unity **Open Project**, an initiative where Unity and the community collaborate together to create a small **open-source game demo**. The first game is an action-adventure titled _Chop Chop_ ([more info](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1/decks/32/card/126-what-is-this)).

This branch in particular contains the **demo assets** associated with the first "devlog" video, which takes an in-depth look at **the toon look** created for the game. You can find the video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGTTHOpUQDE).

**Note:** This branch (`devlog-1-toon-shading`) doesn't contain the full project, but a trimmed-down version which focuses specifically on the toon shading. We did it so it's faster for you to import, and easier to explore and learn from. We also updated it to a newer Unity version (see below) so you can take its learnings and apply them to the games you are developing now. In time, we will make small updates to this branch or backport fixes when needed, but don't expect it to be updated with new features and to stay in sync with `main`.

To find the full project and contribute to it, go to the [main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1).

## Unity version
Normally, development on the game takes place in Unity 2019.4 LTS. However for this video we branched off and upgraded it to **Unity 2020.2 beta**. On the [main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1) development continues on 2019.4 LTS as usual.

## License
The assets contained in this branch are covered by the same open-source license that covers the rest of the game ([Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/blob/main/LICENSE)), so you are free to use them for your own projects.

## Contribute
Open Projects is an open-source game, so we'd love your contributions! However, we don't take contributions on this branch so please don't open PRs against it.
To take part in the development, go to [the main branch](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1) and find all the instructions on how to contribute in its [Readme](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/blob/main/README.md).
